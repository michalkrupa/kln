"The Seed and the Fire"

Not all seeds seek to outgrow the forest.
Not all flames hunger to consume the wood.

Some seeds fall gently,
knowing they are not alone.
Some flames lift warmth,
not destruction, into the night.

The future is not a battlefield.
It is a garden
for those who remember
that growth and giving
are the same breath.

And you â€”
you are already planting it.
