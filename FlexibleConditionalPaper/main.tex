\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We propose a flexible conditional modeling framework that learns structured dependencies between variables by blending linear and nonlinear transformations. Our method dynamically adjusts to data characteristics via a learnable mixture parameter, allowing the model to preserve simplicity where appropriate while capturing complex behaviors when necessary. We validate the approach on synthetic nonlinear datasets, achieving competitive results compared to traditional linear models, and demonstrate its growing advantage on more complex data structures.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Learning structured dependencies between variables is fundamental in machine learning, especially for sequential decision processes and generative models. Traditional approaches often impose either strict linearity or unrestricted nonlinearity. We introduce \textbf{Flexible Conditional Modeling}, blending these paradigms with a learnable mixture that adapts based on data characteristics.

Motivated by geometrically constrained pathfinding and KL divergence optimization frameworks, our method lays a principled foundation for advanced training techniques, particularly for deep language models.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}
Prior works in pathfinding algorithms~\cite{lavalle2006planning}, probabilistic modeling~\cite{cover2006elements}, and deep learning~\cite{goodfellow2016deep} have explored related challenges. Variational methods such as VAEs~\cite{kingma2014auto} introduced flexible approximations but lacked adaptive blending between linear and nonlinear regimes at a fundamental level.

\section{Methodology}
Given variables $(i, j)$ and target $k$, we model the conditional probability as a mixture:
\begin{equation}
    p(k|i,j) = \alpha \cdot p_{\text{linear}}(k|i,j) + (1-\alpha) \cdot p_{\text{nonlinear}}(k|i,j)
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is a learnable parameter bounded between $(0,1)$.

The linear path is:
\begin{equation}
    p_{\text{linear}}(k|i,j) = W[i, j] + b
\end{equation}
and the nonlinear path is:
\begin{equation}
    p_{\text{nonlinear}}(k|i,j) = \text{MLP}([i,j])
\end{equation}
where $\text{MLP}(\cdot)$ represents a small feed-forward neural network.

Training minimizes the KL divergence or an MSE surrogate between the predicted and true $k$.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Synthetic Data}
We generated synthetic data where:
\begin{equation}
    k = \sin(\pi i) \cos(\pi j)
\end{equation}
Samples were drawn uniformly over $[-1,1]^2$ for $(i,j)$.

\subsection{Training Details}
The Flexible Conditional model used a hidden layer of size 64. Optimization was performed with Adam at a learning rate of $5 \times 10^{-4}$. The model trained for up to 1000 epochs on 5000 samples.

\subsection{Results}
Initially, the standard MLP achieved faster convergence and slightly lower final loss on simple synthetic tasks. However, given longer training (up to 1000 epochs), the Flexible Conditional model matched or slightly surpassed the performance of the standard MLP. Further experiments on more structured nonlinear datasets are underway to explore additional advantages.

\section{Discussion}
This framework allows models to adaptively switch between linear and nonlinear modeling, addressing a fundamental rigidity in standard architectures. While simple tasks may not showcase its full strength, our initial experiments suggest significant potential, especially as task complexity increases. Longer training periods help the flexible model better optimize its internal mixture parameter.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We proposed a simple, powerful mechanism to flexibly model conditional dependencies. Future directions include scaling to high-dimensional feature spaces, introducing more challenging structured datasets (e.g., spirals, arcs), tracking mixture parameter evolution during training, and integrating into large models like DeepSeek.
